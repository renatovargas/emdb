Its main output is the GEARS Database of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollution by economic activity.\nIn addition to the database, GEARS also provides scripting facilities for the integration of different data sources, at different tiers of data availability by country and thorough documentation to abide by the principles of replicability, openness, and transparency."

    "text": "The Agrifood Economics and Policy Division (ESA) conducts economic research and policy analysis to support the transformation to more efficient, inclusive, resilient and sustainable agrifood systems for better production, better nutrition, a better environment, and a better life, leaving no one behind. ESA provides evidence-based support to national, regional and global policy processes and initiatives related to monitoring and analysing food and agricultural policies, agribusiness and value chain development, rural transformation and poverty, food security and nutrition information and analysis, resilience, bioeconomy, and climate-smart agriculture. The division also leads the production of two FAO flagship publications: The State of Food and Agriculture (SOFA) and The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World (SOFI).\nWithin ESA, the Monitoring and Analysing Food and Agricultural Policies (MAFAP) programme seeks to establish country owned and sustainable systems to monitor, analyse, and reform food and agricultural policies to enable more effective, efficient and inclusive policy frameworks in 8 developing and emerging economies. MAFAP works with government institutions, research organizations and other partners to create sustainable policy monitoring systems and carry out a consistent set of policy and public expenditure analyses across a wide range of agricultural value chains. MAFAP analyses are used to inform targeted food and agricultural policy reforms that will result in a more conducive environment for agricultural investment and productivity growth, especially for smallholder farmers. As such, MAFAP supports most of FAO strategic objectives, and in particular those of enabling inclusive and efficient agricultural and food systems and helping eliminate hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition.\nA policy optimization modelling tool (that combines a recursive-dynamic computable general equilibrium model and multi-criteria decision-making techniques) is being used by the MAFAP programme team to develop and analyse scenarios where the public budget for the food and agriculture sector can be optimally re-allocated across different support measures (input subsidies, extension services, investments in different types of rural infrastructures, R&D, and so forth) and subsectors/commodities, aiming at improving on one or a combination of inclusive agricultural transformation (IAT) objectives such as: maximizing agrifood GDP, maximizing the number of off- farm jobs created in rural areas (vis-à-vis the number of on-farm jobs), and minimizing rural poverty. Most recently, the objective of minimizing the cost of the least-cost healthy diet was added to the tool. Next extensions to the tool comprise adding other objectives, notably the minimization of greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions that are generated as a result of public expenditures in food and agriculture."

    "text": "The Monitoring and Analysing Food and Agricultural Policies (MAFAP) programme seeks to establish country owned and sustainable systems to monitor, analyse, and reform food and agricultural policies to enable more effective, efficient and inclusive policy frameworks. Since policies are only enacted when they are properly funded, MAFAP tools are particularly geared towards helping countries—the agricultural public sector, in particular—optimize public budgets in the face of competing objectives, like economic growth, poverty reduction, better nutrition, or increasing yields, for example.\nIn the face of increasing vulnerability, climate risk mitigation and adaptation objectives have also become a part of the policy dialogue, as different international commitments (e.g. the Paris Agreement) present new demands and challenges to governments. To be able to provide objective functions within MAFAP tools, it has become necessary to extend its socioeconomic reach to include environmental objectives as well. The Global Emissions Analsyis for Resilient Systems (GEARS) series of modules within MAFAP tools aims to provide a seamless integration of data on anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollution with National Accounts data at different levels of aggregation by economic activity for use with environmentally extended structural analysis frameworks like Computable General Equilibrium and Input-Output models.\nHere we describe the GEARS approach to constructing an anthropogenic emissions accounting satellite framework on demand, based on country-specific socioeconomic information by economic activity, and globally available datasets. We follow the internationally agreed principles of the System of Environmental and Economic Accounts (SEEA) statistical standard (European Commission et al. 2013) to organize information, aiming to maintain compatibility with the System of National Accounts (SNA) with which economic performance is measured (European Commission et al. 2009). Where possible, we adopt approaches suggested by previous efforts at harmonization between Greenhouse Gas Inventories and SEEA and pilot implementations (Eurostat 2015; Flachenecker, Guidetti, and Pionnier 2018; Gutman et al. 2024). Where needed, deviations from international standards follow\nThe main source for emissions from agriculture comes from FAOSTAT (FAO 2024). Emissions from fossil fuel combustion are estimated at the economic activity level, using the Tier 1 method of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change—IPCC—(IPCC 1996, 2006) and national level energy balances. Emissions from Industrial Processes and Waste come from EDGAR (Crippa et al. 2023) and are mapped to economic activities following a broadly tested global approach that facilitate use with CGE frameworks (i.e. that of the Global Trade Analysis Project—GTAP—, Chepeliev 2024a, 2024b, 2024c).\nWhile the outputs of GEARS are databases that rely on the datasets covered above, its innovation lies in the standardization procedures that allow to create such datasets at different levels of aggregation on demand.\n\n\nGases to be reported:\n\nCarbon dioxide (\\(CO_2\\)).\nNitrous oxide (\\(N_2O\\))\nMethane (\\(CH_4\\)).\nFluorinated gases.\n\nOnly as memorandum items:\n\nNitrogen oxides (\\(NOx\\)).\nCarbon monoxide (\\(CO\\)).\nVolatile compounds distinct from methane (\\(COVDM\\)).\nSulfur dioxide (\\(SO_2\\)).\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions are divided into four main groups:\n\nEnergy.\nIndustrial processes.\nAgriculture, forestry, land use.\nWaste.\n\nUsing Global Warming Potential (GWP), GHGs are aggregated to \\(CO_2 equivalent\\) or simply \\(CO_2e\\)).\nCRF - Common Reporting Format.\n\n\n\nExplain the generic structure of an emissions account.\n{fig-air-emissions-account}\n\n\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Statistical Office of the European Communities, Eurostat, developed a methodology for estimating Air Emissions Accounts under the SEEA-CF, based on the National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (NGGI) submitted to the UNFCCC (Eurostat 2015; Flachenecker, Guidetti, and Pionnier 2018). Our approach was informed by a recent exercise conducted at the country level in Argentina (Gutman et al. 2024).\nThe OECD-Eurostat methodology uses emission data from the National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (NGGI) as a starting point and assigns these emissions to households and industries according to ISIC Revision 4, using the same concepts and classifications as the System of National Accounts (SNA).
